# **Inspired from**
Tech giants like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and other large firms know "secret traits about you that you didn't even know you were sharing information about" by looking at your data obtained from multiple sources.
<br>

So the fundamental idea behind the project is to use our own data to study our own behavior and optimize our work efficiency by leveraging the power of AI algorithms and analytics.


We get to know

* Micro habit's
* Our working pattern
* Our biases
* When & where we spent our time.
& More...

<br>

# **Description**

This is a Desktop Application for users who spend a lot of time on there PC/Laptop.<br>
Using Artificial Intelligence and Analytics , this software aims to help user in introspecting there action/activity for a long period of time.

<br>

# **Key Features**
It contains various plots to visualize the activity of the user.

* A graph depicting how active we are at various times of the day. This provides us with a quantitative analysis of what hours of the day we typically work and how long we work continuously or in a concentration cycle, for example.

* We learn about the time allocation that we give to various areas such as entertainment, education, and so on.

* A relative scale which shows us the comparison between the amount of activity that we are doing on different days.

* A class distribution graph that shows us what type of activity we were doing at what time of day. This allows us to distinguish between when we are having fun and when we are working.

* The last graph shows as the source we are using to follow different activities. Like while working on AI & ML I used X,Y,Z sites the most etc.

* Apart from that, we can examine the time comparison for different days as well as the overall activities we have done in different months of the year, which offers us a holistic view of whether or not we are improving with time.
